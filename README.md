## Getting started

`git clone path-to-your-repo`
`command_to_install_dependencies` (e.g. `bundle`)

## Usage
[(1) How to install it (what to clone, what to run to get all dependencies)]

`command_to_start` (e.g. `rackup` or `rails s`)
Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`

[(2) How to run it (is it a command line tool? Do you have to load it into IRB? Is is a web application? What port needs to be used?)]

## Running tests

`test_command` (e.g. `rspec`)

Later on, you can add screenshots and additional information to your heart's content, but make sure you have this with all your repos as you proceed through the course. You will thank yourself later.
