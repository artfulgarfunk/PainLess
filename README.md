# PainLess - The Pain Management Web App

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/shezdev/final_project/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/shezdev/final_project?branch=master)

#Synopsis

An app that tracks environmental factors and returns data correlated with levels of pain which the user inputs.

#Motivation

The purpose of this is to allow those who suffer with chronic conditions such as Arthritis and IBS to track their daily pain levels alongside environmental factors such as food and activities. This allows them to identify possible triggers for sudden flare ups - e.g. certain foods that may exacerbate their symptoms.

## Getting started

#Installation

`git clone artfulgarfunk/final_project`
`bundle install`
`bin/rails s`

#Test

Run `rspec` in your terminal in the project folder
